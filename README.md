## Introduction

Welcome to my 2D platformer side project! I started this project off during the BNTA full stack software engineering bootcamp and wanted to create a simple video game using Java.

My journey starts off with learning Java and OOP, which then prepared me enough to understand the workings behind programming styles. 

The framework I used is [LibGdx](https://libgdx.com/).

The apps I use are [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) and [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/).

Useful resources for art and music are [Open Game Art](https://opengameart.org/) and [Free Sound](https://freesound.org/).

I first started off watching [Small Pixel Games](https://www.youtube.com/@smallpixelgames2899) tutorial on making a 2D platformer, and then advanced onwards through expanding the way I want the game to be and the rules behind it.

Currently I am still developing this game and figuring out how I want it to be designed.

Collaborators are more than welcome!!

The game so far has a few key implementations generally listed below,

- Main Menu screen
- Game screen
- Background music
- Game Over screen

And player related,

- Animations (90%)
- Health 
- Physics 
    * Moving
    * Swimming
    * Double jump
    * Climbing ladders
- Proper one way platforms
